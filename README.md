# Arabidopsis Root Segmentation using K-Means

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook designed for segmenting Arabidopsis root images using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, you need to have Anaconda installed on your system. If Anaconda is not installed, download and install it from [Anaconda's website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the notebook:

1. **Navigate to the desired directory**

   Use the command line to navigate to the desired directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/MyDirectory
   ```

2. **Create a Conda environment**

   ```bash
   conda create -n myenv python=3.10
   ```
3. **Activate the Conda environment**

   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```
4. **Install Jupyter Notebook in the environment**

   ```bash
   conda install -n myenv jupyter
   ```
5. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Navigate to the notebook file and open it. Then, run the cells sequentially to perform segmentation of an input image.
